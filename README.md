# Kobold+ Fight Club
=================
Kobold+ Fight Club is a complete rewrite of Kobold Fight Club by Fantasy Computerworks that seeks to address a number of concerns with the original: 
- [x] The project needs new maintainers (Oh hey that's us)
- [x] Need to stop using Google Sheets API as a database+backend
- [ ] Migration method for existing custom content from Google Sheets to another data source (Needs to be as easy to setup and maintain as we can get it)
- [ ] Good way to accept and moderate submissions for new source book creatures
- [ ] Login/sync between devices
- [ ] Update old/outdated versions of various packages
- [ ] Any improvements we can think of!

## Extra Content
The "extra content" from Kobold Fight Club isn't compatible with K+FC yet, but we're looking into this.

## Adding your own custom content to Kobold Fight Club
Not available just yet, more on this when it's built out.

## Contributing content to Kobold Fight Club
Coming Soonâ„¢

## Technical stuff
In case you're interested in contributing code, we're building this iteration of KFC+ with AlpineJS and TailwindCSS. 

The build process uses Laravel Mix, just for convenience of setup and browser-sync.  

## Node Commands
- npm ci - Install necessary dependencies
